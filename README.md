### Data Structures
- Arrays, Matrices, and Linked Lists are called as physical data structure and they define how the data is arranged in the memory.
- Stacks, Queue, Tree, Graph, and Hashing are logical data structures. So this defines how the data can be utilized, how the arrangement is and how it should be utilized.
